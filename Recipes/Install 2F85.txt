# Install 2F85
# Example to install a tool when none is currently installed
# We just select the new tool, move to the mount position, prompt the operator, and move to move_tool_home

# Change to whatever tool you like
tool=2F85

# Operator confirmation
prompt(About to mount {tool})

# Mounting process
select_tool({tool})  # This only informs the robot what is mounted

# This does the physical swap
